## ‚úÖ Session Notes - June 11, 2025 (Session 2)

### **üîß Bug Fixes and Polish Applied:**

**iOS Dog Park Check-in Bug Fix:**
- **Issue**: Check-in dialog wasn't dismissing after successful check-in
- **Root Cause**: Synchronous callback wasn't waiting for async API call completion
- **Solution**: Made check-in callbacks async and added proper sheet dismissal logic
- **Files Modified**: `CheckInSheetView.swift`, `ParkDetailView.swift`, `DogParksViewModel.swift`

**API Response Decoding Fix:**
- **Issue**: "Data couldn't be read because it is missing" error during check-in
- **Root Cause**: Backend CheckIn model missing `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields
- **Solution**: Made these fields optional in Swift CheckIn model
- **Added Debug Logging**: Enhanced API error logging to identify future decoding issues

**Build Warning Cleanup:**
- Fixed unused variable warnings in DogParksViewModel
- Updated deprecated Map API to use modern iOS 17+ syntax with Marker instead of MapPin
- Fixed async task warnings in CheckInSheetView
- All compiler warnings eliminated

### **üì± Current iOS App Status:**

The app now provides users with a comprehensive database of 103 dog parks including all major NYC locations with rich metadata for enhanced discovery and decision-making.

## ‚úÖ Session Notes - June 12, 2025 (Session 5)

### **üîç Redesigned Dog Park Search Functionality:**

**Search UI/UX Overhaul:**
- **Removed**: Radius slider and reload button (redundant controls)
- **Added**: Text search box at top of screen for park name/location search
- **Default Radius**: Changed from 10km to 2km for more focused initial view
- **Dynamic Loading**: Parks load automatically based on visible map area during scroll/zoom
- **Search Results**: Dropdown list shows up to 5 results sorted by distance from user

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Created `SearchResultsList.swift` component with distance-based sorting
  - Added real-time search with debouncing in `DogParksViewModel`
  - Integrated search UI into `DogParksView` with clean animations
  - Results show park name, distance, activity level, and visitor count

- **Backend API**:
  - Added `/api/parks/search` endpoint supporting text queries
  - Implemented `DogPark.search()` and `DogPark.searchWithLocation()` methods
  - Search matches against name, description, address, and borough fields
  - Results prioritized by relevance (name matches first)

### **üêõ Bug Fixes Applied:**

**Asset Color Warning Fix:**
- **Issue**: "No color named 'green' found in asset catalog" runtime warnings
- **Solution**: Added `activityColorSwiftUI` computed property returning SwiftUI Colors
- **Files**: Updated `DogPark.swift`, `SearchResultsList.swift`, `ParkDetailView.swift`

**Search API Decoding Error:**
- **Issue**: "Failed to search parks: The data couldn't be read because it is missing"
- **Root Cause**: Backend returning NYC fields not in iOS model
- **Solution**: Added all NYC dog run fields as optional properties to DogPark model
- **New Fields**: website, phone, rating, reviewCount, surfaceType, hasSeating, zipcode, borough

**Date Field Handling:**
- Made `createdAt` and `updatedAt` optional in decoding to handle missing data
- Fixed preview data in `SearchResultsList` to use ISO 8601 date strings

### **üìä Current Implementation Status:**
- **Search Feature**: ‚úÖ Fully functional with location-based sorting
- **Map Interaction**: ‚úÖ Dynamic park loading based on visible region
- **Error Handling**: ‚úÖ Comprehensive decoding error logging
- **UI Polish**: ‚úÖ Clean, intuitive search interface following Apple HIG

### **üéØ Future Enhancements:**
1. **Search Filters**: Add options to filter by amenities, ratings, surface type
2. **Recent Searches**: Store and display user's search history
3. **Voice Search**: Integrate Siri for hands-free park discovery
4. **Advanced Matching**: Fuzzy search for typo tolerance

## ‚úÖ Session Notes - June 12, 2025 (Session 4)

### **üó∫Ô∏è Fixed NYC Dog Parks Map Visibility:**

**Issue Identified:**
- **Problem**: NYC dog parks weren't showing on the map despite being in the database
- **Root Cause**: Default 10km search radius from Piermont location excluded NYC parks (30+ km away)
- **Impact**: Users couldn't discover the 91 newly imported NYC dog runs

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Dynamic Park Loading**: Parks now load based on visible map region as user scrolls/zooms
- **Smart Radius Calculation**: Radius automatically adjusts based on map span (diagonal distance)
- **Debounced API Calls**: 500ms debounce prevents excessive API requests during map movement
- **One-Way Data Flow**: Fixed map snapping back by removing two-way region binding

**Technical Details:**
- **New Method**: `loadParksForRegion()` calculates appropriate radius from map span
- **Region Monitoring**: `onMapCameraChange` modifier tracks map movement
- **Performance**: Efficient loading only fetches parks within visible area
- **Files Modified**: `DogParksView.swift`, `DogParksViewModel.swift`

### **üìç Current Map Behavior:**
- **Initial Load**: Centers on user location or defaults to Piermont
- **Dynamic Loading**: All 103 parks load as users explore different areas
- **Smooth Experience**: No more map snapping or jumping issues
- **NYC Access**: Full access to all NYC dog runs by panning to Manhattan/Brooklyn

### **üéØ Remaining Map Enhancements:**
1. **Loading Indicator**: Show spinner during park fetches
2. **Cache Layer**: Store recently viewed regions to reduce API calls
3. **Clustering**: Group nearby parks at low zoom levels for performance
4. **Search Integration**: Add "Search this area" button for explicit reloads
