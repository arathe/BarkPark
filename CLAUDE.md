# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

BarkPark is a dog social network application consisting of:
- Node.js/Express backend API with PostgreSQL database
- iOS SwiftUI app with cloud-first architecture
- Features: user auth, dog profiles, park finder, social messaging, check-ins

## Custom Commands

### `/barkpark test`
- Run full test suite for both backend and iOS
- Check API connectivity between local and production
- Verify database migrations are up to date

### `/barkpark deploy`
- Test locally first
- Commit and push changes to trigger Railway redeploy
- Verify deployment health endpoints
- Update CLAUDE.md with deployment notes

### `/barkpark debug [component]`
- Add comprehensive logging to specified component
- Common components: auth, parks, dogs, friends, checkins
- Include both backend and iOS debugging

### `/barkpark schema`
- Show current database schema
- Identify any mismatches between model and actual database
- Suggest migrations if needed

## Schema Alignment Protocol

**Before modifying database models or schema:**
1. **Check Current Schema**: Query information_schema to see actual table structure
2. **Compare with Models**: Verify backend models match database reality
3. **Test Queries**: Run sample queries to ensure they work with actual schema
4. **Update Both Sides**: Keep models and database in sync during changes

**Key Areas to Monitor:**
- PostGIS vs simple lat/lng columns in dog_parks table
- Optional vs required fields (handle NULL values properly)
- Column naming consistency (snake_case vs camelCase)
- Foreign key relationships and constraints

## Debugging Methodology

When encountering errors or issues, follow this systematic approach:

### Production Issue Investigation
1. **Gather Evidence First**: Check server logs, Railway deployment logs, actual API responses
2. **Test with Real Data**: Use actual auth tokens, real requests, current database state
3. **Avoid Assumptions**: Don't assume authentication/network issues without evidence
4. **Isolate Components**: Test backend independently from frontend when possible
5. **Check Schema Alignment**: Verify models match actual database structure

### Error Analysis Priority
1. **Server Logs**: Check Railway/backend logs for exact error messages
2. **Database State**: Verify schema matches model expectations
3. **Environment Config**: Confirm all required environment variables are set
4. **API Response**: Examine actual HTTP status codes and response bodies
5. **Frontend Handling**: Check if client-side error handling is appropriate

### Environment-Specific Considerations

**Production (Railway) Issues:**
- Check Railway dashboard logs and deployment status
- Verify environment variables are set correctly (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, NODE_ENV)
- Test with production API endpoints directly using curl
- Consider SSL certificate and CORS issues
- Monitor resource limits and connection pooling

**Local Development Issues:**
- Check if local database is running and accessible
- Verify local environment variables in .env file
- Test API endpoints on localhost:3000
- Ensure migrations are up to date locally
- Check for port conflicts or service availability

## ‚úÖ Session Notes - June 12, 2025 (Session 4)

### **üó∫Ô∏è Fixed NYC Dog Parks Map Visibility:**

**Issue Identified:**
- **Problem**: NYC dog parks weren't showing on the map despite being in the database
- **Root Cause**: Default 10km search radius from Piermont location excluded NYC parks (30+ km away)
- **Impact**: Users couldn't discover the 91 newly imported NYC dog runs

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Dynamic Park Loading**: Parks now load based on visible map region as user scrolls/zooms
- **Smart Radius Calculation**: Radius automatically adjusts based on map span (diagonal distance)
- **Debounced API Calls**: 500ms debounce prevents excessive API requests during map movement
- **One-Way Data Flow**: Fixed map snapping back by removing two-way region binding

**Technical Details:**
- **New Method**: `loadParksForRegion()` calculates appropriate radius from map span
- **Region Monitoring**: `onMapCameraChange` modifier tracks map movement
- **Performance**: Efficient loading only fetches parks within visible area
- **Files Modified**: `DogParksView.swift`, `DogParksViewModel.swift`

### **üìç Current Map Behavior:**
- **Initial Load**: Centers on user location or defaults to Piermont
- **Dynamic Loading**: All 103 parks load as users explore different areas
- **Smooth Experience**: No more map snapping or jumping issues
- **NYC Access**: Full access to all NYC dog runs by panning to Manhattan/Brooklyn

### **üéØ Remaining Map Enhancements:**
1. **Loading Indicator**: Show spinner during park fetches
2. **Cache Layer**: Store recently viewed regions to reduce API calls
3. **Clustering**: Group nearby parks at low zoom levels for performance
4. **Search Integration**: Add "Search this area" button for explicit reloads

## ‚úÖ Session Notes - June 12, 2025 (Session 5)

### **üîç Redesigned Dog Park Search Functionality:**

**Search UI/UX Overhaul:**
- **Removed**: Radius slider and reload button (redundant controls)
- **Added**: Text search box at top of screen for park name/location search
- **Default Radius**: Changed from 10km to 2km for more focused initial view
- **Dynamic Loading**: Parks load automatically based on visible map area during scroll/zoom
- **Search Results**: Dropdown list shows up to 5 results sorted by distance from user

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Created `SearchResultsList.swift` component with distance-based sorting
  - Added real-time search with debouncing in `DogParksViewModel`
  - Integrated search UI into `DogParksView` with clean animations
  - Results show park name, distance, activity level, and visitor count

- **Backend API**:
  - Added `/api/parks/search` endpoint supporting text queries
  - Implemented `DogPark.search()` and `DogPark.searchWithLocation()` methods
  - Search matches against name, description, address, and borough fields
  - Results prioritized by relevance (name matches first)

### **üêõ Bug Fixes Applied:**

**Asset Color Warning Fix:**
- **Issue**: "No color named 'green' found in asset catalog" runtime warnings
- **Solution**: Added `activityColorSwiftUI` computed property returning SwiftUI Colors
- **Files**: Updated `DogPark.swift`, `SearchResultsList.swift`, `ParkDetailView.swift`

**Search API Decoding Error:**
- **Issue**: "Failed to search parks: The data couldn't be read because it is missing"
- **Root Cause**: Backend returning NYC fields not in iOS model
- **Solution**: Added all NYC dog run fields as optional properties to DogPark model
- **New Fields**: website, phone, rating, reviewCount, surfaceType, hasSeating, zipcode, borough

**Date Field Handling:**
- Made `createdAt` and `updatedAt` optional in decoding to handle missing data
- Fixed preview data in `SearchResultsList` to use ISO 8601 date strings
