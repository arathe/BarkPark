- `GET /api/parks/:id/activity` - Real-time park activity level and visitor statistics
- `POST /api/parks/:id/checkin` - Check into park with optional dog companions list
- `PUT /api/parks/:id/checkout` - Check out with automatic visit duration tracking
- `GET /api/parks/user/history` - Personal check-in history with park details
- `GET /api/parks/user/active` - Current active check-ins across all parks
- `GET /api/parks/:id/friends` - Friends currently at specific park (foundation)
- `POST /api/parks` - Admin endpoint for creating new parks

**ðŸ“Š Database Schema Additions:**
- **dog_parks table** - Name, description, address, lat/lng, amenities, rules, hours
- **checkins table** - User/park relationships with check-in/out timestamps and dog companions
- **Activity calculations** - Real-time park busyness based on active check-ins
- **Distance queries** - Haversine formula implementation for geographic proximity
- **Test database** - Automated schema initialization and data seeding for tests

**ðŸŽ¯ Technical Highlights:**

- **Activity Levels** - Dynamic calculation: 0=quiet, 1-3=low, 4-8=moderate, 9+=busy
- **Park Statistics** - Total check-ins, current visitors, average visit duration
- **Comprehensive Testing** - Parks API (32 tests) + CheckIn model (20 tests) all passing
- **Error Handling** - Validation for coordinates, park existence, duplicate check-ins
- **Security** - JWT authentication required on all protected endpoints

**ðŸ†• Complete Dog Profile Management (Previous Session):**
- **Full CRUD Operations** - Create, Read, Update, and Delete dog profiles with confirmation
- **Dog Deletion** - Added delete functionality with confirmation dialog and loading overlay  
- **Navigation Fix** - Dog cards in "My Pack" now properly navigate to detail view
- **Gallery Photo Management** - Immediate deletion on trash icon tap (no save required)
- **Photo Display Fix** - All gallery grids now show photos as squares to prevent overlap
- **Model Decoding Fix** - Handle PostgreSQL DECIMAL values (weight) returned as strings

**ðŸ”§ Key Technical Improvements:**
- **Dog Model** - Added custom decoder to handle weight as string or double from PostgreSQL
- **APIService** - Added `deleteDog()` method for profile deletion
- **DogProfileViewModel** - Added `deleteDog()` method with local state management
- **Gallery Management** - Changed from mark-and-save to immediate deletion workflow
- **Photo Grid Layout** - Fixed aspect ratio issues with square frames (100x100, 150x150) and `.clipped()`
- **Navigation** - Added NavigationLink wrapper to DogCard for proper detail view navigation

**ðŸ“± UI/UX Enhancements:**
- **Delete Flow** - Menu button â†’ Delete option â†’ Confirmation â†’ Loading overlay â†’ Auto-dismiss

### **Phase 3: Enhanced Park Features (Future)**
**Goal**: Advanced park features and community engagement

**Potential Features:**
- Park photo uploads from users
- Park reviews and ratings system
- Event scheduling and park meetups
- Advanced park filtering (amenities, size, etc.)
- Park check-in streaks and gamification
- Weather integration for park conditions

## Development Guidelines

### **Backend Development:**
- Server runs on port 3000 - verify status at start of each session
- Use `npm test` to run comprehensive test suite (52 tests)
- Park data seeded around Piermont, NY coordinates (41.0387, -73.9215)
- Distance calculations use Haversine formula (no PostGIS required)
- All park endpoints require JWT authentication

### **iOS Development:**
- Dog weight values come from PostgreSQL as strings - custom decoder handles this
- All gallery photos should display as squares with fixed dimensions to prevent overlap
- Delete operations use immediate deletion pattern for better UX
- Navigation uses NavigationLink with proper EnvironmentObject passing
- Location services will require proper Info.plist permissions for park discovery

### **Testing & Quality:**
- Backend: 32 Parks API tests + 20 CheckIn model tests (all passing)
- iOS: Existing auth and dog profile tests should continue passing
- Test with realistic park data around Piermont, NY for location accuracy
- Ensure proper error handling for location permissions and network issues
