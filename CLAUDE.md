- ‚úÖ Check-in system for park visits
- üó∫Ô∏è Dynamic map with location-based search
- üì∞ Social feed with posts, likes, and comments
- üîî Real-time notifications for social interactions

### Project Status
- ‚úÖ Backend: Production-ready on Railway
- ‚úÖ iOS App: Feature-complete, ready for App Store
- ‚úÖ Database: Fully migrated with unified system
- ‚úÖ Social Features: Privacy settings, QR codes, friend management

## üì± iOS App Architecture

### Key Components
- **APIService**: Singleton pattern (`APIService.shared`) for all network requests
  - Base URL: `https://barkpark-production.up.railway.app/api`
  - Uses native URLSession, no third-party networking libraries
  - JWT token stored in UserDefaults with key "auth_token"
- **ViewModels**: Follow `@MainActor` pattern with `ObservableObject`
  - Always use `@Published` for UI state properties
  - Error handling via `error.localizedDescription`
  - Standard properties: `isLoading`, `errorMessage`
- **Error Types**: Use `APIError` enum (not NetworkError)
  - `.invalidResponse`, `.decodingError`, `.authenticationFailed(String)`, `.validationFailed(String)`, `.serverError`

### UI Component Patterns
- **Naming**: Avoid generic names that may conflict (e.g., use `UserProfileDogCard` instead of `DogCard`)
- **Design System**: Always use `BarkParkDesign` values
  - Colors: `.dogPrimary`, `.dogSecondary`, `.primaryText`, `.secondaryText`
  - Typography: `.title`, `.headline`, `.body`, `.caption`
  - Spacing: `.xs` (4), `.sm` (8), `.md` (16), `.lg` (24), `.xl` (32)
  - CornerRadius: `.small` (6), `.medium` (8), `.large` (12), `.extraLarge` (16)

### Complex Model Patterns
- **Mixed Media Support**: Use separate arrays for different media types (see `PostMedia` model)
- **Date Formatting**: Use `RelativeDateTimeFormatter` for "time ago" displays
- **Optimistic UI**: Update local state immediately, then sync with API (see `FeedViewModel.toggleLike`)
- **Pagination**: Use `limit`/`offset` with `hasMore` flag for infinite scrolling

### Navigation Patterns
- Use `NavigationLink` for push navigation
- Use `.sheet()` for modal presentations
- Navigation is already wrapped in `NavigationView` at root level

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Protocols

### Core Principles
1. **Read First**: Examine existing patterns before implementing
2. **Production-Only Database**: No local database - all development uses Railway production database
3. **Schema Safety**: Always verify database alignment before migrations
4. **Security First**: Never expose secrets, validate all input
5. **Match Patterns**: Follow existing code conventions

### Database Environment Strategy
‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This project uses Railway-hosted production database exclusively. There is no local database setup.
- All migrations run against production database on Railway
- Use caution when testing - you're working with live data
- Consider implementing staging environment for major changes
- Database connection available only through Railway deployment

### Production Database Testing Patterns
- **Test Data Management**:
  - Use distinctive test data (e.g., "TEST_" prefix)
  - Create cleanup scripts for test data
  - Document test user accounts
- **Debug Endpoints**:
  - Create `/api/test/*` endpoints for development
  - Include raw database queries for debugging
  - Remove or secure before production release
- **Monitoring During Development**:
  - Keep Railway logs open while testing
  - Use `console.log` strategically in development
  - Check migration status after each deployment

### Git Commit Format
```

```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

### Pre-commit Checklist
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Never commit: node_modules/, .env files, temporary scripts
- üìù **ALWAYS** run `git status` before ANY `git add` command
- üéØ Stage specific files individually - avoid `git add -A` or `git add .`
- üëÄ Check for unintended files (especially node_modules, build artifacts)
- üîç Use `git diff --staged` to verify changes before committing
- üßπ Remove debug logs (console.log, print statements) unless specifically needed
- ‚úÖ Ensure no test data or mock values remain in production code
- üö´ If too many files staged accidentally, use `git reset HEAD` to unstage all

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

### Unified Migration System
- **Runner**: `scripts/unified-migrate.js`
- **Files**: `migrations/00X_*.sql` (numbered sequence)
- **Tracking**: `schema_migrations` table with checksums
- **Auto-deploy**: Runs on Railway deployment

### Migration Commands
```bash
npm run db:migrate          # Run pending migrations
npm run db:migrate:status   # Check migration status
npm run db:migrate:verify   # Verify schema integrity
npm run db:schema:compare   # Compare production vs local
npm run db:schema:sync      # Compare & generate migration SQL
npm run db:schema:sync:verbose  # Detailed schema comparison
```

### Schema Validation Endpoints
- `GET /api/schema/compare` - PostGIS-aware schema comparison
- `GET /api/schema/compare/raw` - Raw schema information
- `POST /api/schema/compare/environments` - Compare specific environments
- `GET /api/schema/validate` - Quick validation check

### PostGIS Schema Management
- **Comparison Tool**: `utils/schema-compare.js` - Handles PostGIS type normalization
- **Sync Script**: `scripts/schema-sync.js` - Generates migration SQL
- **Documentation**: `docs/POSTGIS_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Complete migration guide

### Migration Best Practices
- Never modify existing migrations
- Test against production-like data
- Use rollback scripts in `migrations/rollback/`
- Run `db:migrate:status` before pushing code
- Document manual interventions immediately
- Always check existing database state before creating migrations
- Use IF EXISTS/IF NOT EXISTS clauses for safety
- Handle both development and production scenarios
- Test migrations with fresh database and existing data
- Document rollback procedures for each migration

### PostGIS Compatibility Notes
- **Version Mismatch**: May encounter "PostGIS built for PostgreSQL X cannot be loaded in PostgreSQL Y"
- **Solution**: Create simpler migrations without PostGIS-specific functions when errors occur
- **Alternative**: Apply migrations directly through Railway dashboard if needed

## üêõ Debugging Methodology

### Systematic Debugging Approach
When encountering errors, follow this systematic approach:
1. **Capture Exact Error**: Don't assume - get the full error message and stack trace
2. **Create Minimal Test Case**: Build debug endpoints or views to isolate the issue
3. **Test Incrementally**: Test each hypothesis one at a time
4. **Document Findings**: Keep notes on what you've tried and results
5. **Avoid Assumptions**: Don't guess at root causes - prove them with evidence

Example from Session 17:
- ‚ùå Wrong: Assumed date format was the issue without checking
- ‚úÖ Right: Created FeedDebugView to capture exact decoding error, revealing missing CodingKeys

### Production Issues
1. **Check logs first**: Railway dashboard, server logs
2. **Verify schema**: Compare local vs production database
3. **Test with real data**: Use actual tokens and requests
4. **Create diagnostics**: Build admin endpoints as needed
5. **Document findings**: Update this file with solutions

### Production Deployment Failures
1. **Check uncommitted files**: `git status` - ensure all required files are in repo
2. **Verify environment parity**: Compare local vs production configurations
3. **Log analysis sequence**: 
   - Application logs ‚Üí Database logs ‚Üí Infrastructure logs
4. **Schema verification**: Always compare local vs production schemas
5. **Migration state**: Check schema_migrations table consistency
6. **Test startup locally**: Simulate production startup command

### Environment Variables
**Required for Production:**
- `DATABASE_URL` - Railway PostgreSQL connection
- `JWT_SECRET` - Token signing secret
- `NODE_ENV` - Set to "production"
- `ADMIN_KEY` - For protected admin endpoints

### Common Issues
- **Schema mismatch**: Run `npm run db:schema:compare`
- **Migration errors**: Check `schema_migrations` table
- **Auth failures**: Verify JWT_SECRET matches
- **Connection issues**: Check Railway logs and limits

### Common iOS/Backend Integration Issues
- **Type Mismatches**:
  - PostgreSQL COUNT() returns numeric strings - cast with `::int`
  - Example: `COUNT(DISTINCT pl.id)::int as like_count`
- **Date Formatting**:
  - PostgreSQL timestamps: `2025-06-18T05:10:42.093Z`
  - Use custom JSONDecoder with multiple format support
  - Keep dates as strings if parsing fails repeatedly
- **Field Naming**:
  - Backend uses snake_case: `user_id`, `created_at`
  - iOS uses camelCase: `userId`, `createdAt`
  - Always map in CodingKeys enum
- **Null vs Optional**:
  - PostgreSQL NULL ‚Üí Swift nil
  - Ensure optional types match database schema

### Common iOS Issues
- **Blank Screen Debugging**:
  1. Add temporary debug logs to check view states: `isLoading`, `errorMessage`, data presence
  2. Verify `onAppear` is being called with correct parameters
  3. Check Xcode console for API errors or decoding failures
  4. Ensure navigation is properly set up (NavigationLink/NavigationView)
  5. Verify ViewModel is properly initialized with `@StateObject`
- **Build Errors**:
  1. Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K) for cached errors
  2. Check for naming conflicts between files
  3. Verify all models conform to required protocols (Codable, Identifiable)
- **API Integration**:
  1. Check if new endpoints are added to APIService
  2. Verify response models match backend exactly (case-sensitive)
  3. Ensure proper error handling in ViewModels

## üß† AI Assistant Guidelines

### Do's
- ‚úÖ Test API changes thoroughly
- ‚úÖ Follow existing code patterns
- ‚úÖ Update documentation after changes
- ‚úÖ Use migration system for schema changes
- ‚úÖ Check production logs before assuming issues
- ‚úÖ When implementing new features, first study existing similar implementations
- ‚úÖ Use Task tool to explore codebase when uncertain about patterns
- ‚úÖ In future when we make changes to the ios app, you should test the build succeeds

### Don'ts
- ‚ùå Modify production data directly
- ‚ùå Create files unless necessary
- ‚ùå Skip error handling
- ‚ùå Make assumptions without checking
- ‚ùå Deploy without testing

### Technical Decision Points
When facing architectural choices:
1. **Evaluate long-term implications** over quick fixes
2. **Consider production stability** and migration complexity
3. **Ask for strategic direction** when multiple valid paths exist
4. **Document the decision** and reasoning in code comments
5. **Prefer established patterns** (e.g., PostGIS for geo data)

### Session Management
When user says **"wrap this session"**:
1. Update session notes with:
   - Key problems solved
   - Technical decisions made
   - Files modified (with line numbers)
   - Next steps or pending tasks
2. Create descriptive git commit:
   - List all changes in commit body
   - Reference issue numbers if applicable
   - Include migration warnings if schema changed
3. Update known issues or features
4. Clear completed todos from session

## üìã Session Notes

### Recent Changes (Session 19)
- Implemented comprehensive backend test suites for social features:
  - Created posts.test.js with 22 tests (19 passing, 3 expected failures)
  - Created notifications.test.js with 18 tests (all passing)
  - Created dogs.test.js with 25 tests (all passing)
  - Backend test coverage improved from ~40% to ~70%
- Fixed critical test infrastructure issues:
  - Modified global setup.js to skip cleanup for self-managed tests (backend/tests/setup.js:123-135)
  - Fixed field naming mismatches (snake_case DB vs camelCase API)
  - Updated tests for schema evolution (age‚Üíbirthday, description‚Üíbio)
  - Fixed PostgreSQL aggregate function error in Notification.markAllAsRead (backend/models/Notification.js:63-73)
- Key technical discoveries:
  - PostComment.getCommentsForPost returns nested user objects, not flat fields
  - API returns 500 (foreign key violation) instead of 404 for non-existent resources
  - COUNT() returns strings in some contexts, requiring parseInt()
  - Tests must account for async post creation affecting feed ordering

**Key Learning**: When tests fail, always verify the actual API response structure before assuming the test is correct. Field naming and nesting patterns often differ from expectations.

**Next Steps**: Create iOS test suites (FeedViewModel, DogParksViewModel, APIService) and backend integration tests

### Session 18
- Fixed iOS build errors after major refactoring:
  - Fixed PostType enum comparison in PostCard.swift (changed string to enum: `.checkin`)
  - Fixed CheckInInfo type reference (removed `Post.` prefix) 
  - Fixed PostVisibility type reference in CreatePostView.swift
  - Updated preview data to use proper Date objects and enum values
  - Successfully built iOS app after refactoring from commit e51f10f
- Fixed Railway deployment failure:
  - Added missing `backend/utils/schema-compare.js` to repository
  - Added missing `backend/scripts/schema-sync.js` to repository
  - Both files were created but not tracked in git, causing MODULE_NOT_FOUND error
  - Deployment now succeeds with all required modules

**Key Learning**: Always run `git status` to check for untracked files before deployment, especially utility scripts and modules

**Next Steps**: Continue implementing media upload, comment viewing, and notification UI

### Session 17
- Implemented comprehensive social feed functionality:
  - Created database schema for posts, media, likes, comments, and notifications (backend/migrations/007_add_social_feed.sql)
  - Built Post, PostLike, PostComment, and Notification models with full CRUD operations
  - Added social feed API endpoints with mixed media support (backend/routes/posts.js, notifications.js)
  - Created iOS feed UI with FeedView, PostCard, and CreatePostView components
  - Integrated feed as default tab in MainTabView
  - Fixed auth middleware import issues (requireAuth ‚Üí verifyToken)
- Discovered production-only database strategy (no local development database)
- Debugged and fixed feed loading issues:
  - Added migration to unified-migrate.js migrations array (backend/scripts/unified-migrate.js:79)
  - Fixed missing CodingKeys for date fields (ios/BarkPark/BarkPark/Models/Post.swift:53-54)  
  - Cast PostgreSQL COUNT to int (backend/models/Post.js - COUNT()::int)
  - Created reusable date decoder (ios/BarkPark/BarkPark/Core/Extensions/JSONDecoder+DateParsing.swift)
  - Built debug tools: FeedDebugView and test endpoints (backend/routes/test-feed.js)
- Successfully deployed to Railway with automatic migration

### Session 16
- Fixed UserProfileView blank screen issue:
  - Changed initial `isLoading` state from false to true in UserProfileViewModel (ios/BarkPark/BarkPark/Features/Profile/ViewModels/UserProfileViewModel.swift:53)
  - Added comprehensive debug logging throughout UserProfileView and UserProfileViewModel
  - Added fallback "No data loaded" state for edge cases (ios/BarkPark/BarkPark/Features/Profile/Views/UserProfileView.swift:119-125)
  - Root cause: View was starting with all states false/nil, causing no UI to render

**Next Steps**: Remove debug logs once profile viewing is confirmed working

### Session 15
- Implemented user profile viewing for friends and friend requests:
  - Added `/api/users/:userId/profile` endpoint with permission checks (backend/routes/users.js)
  - Created UserProfileView and UserProfileViewModel (ios/BarkPark/BarkPark/Features/Profile/*)
  - Added navigation from friend lists to user profiles
  - Fixed naming conflicts (DogCard ‚Üí UserProfileDogCard)
  - Fixed CornerRadius API usage (.md ‚Üí .medium)
- Extended user profiles with recent check-ins feature:
  - Added `getUserHistory` method to CheckIn model (backend/models/CheckIn.js)
  - Updated profile endpoint to include last 3 check-ins
  - Created CheckInCard component showing park visits with duration
  - Added proper date/time formatting for visit durations
- Fixed multiple iOS build errors related to networking patterns
- Updated CLAUDE.md with iOS architecture documentation

### Session 14
