## üóÑÔ∏è Database Management

### Current Database State
- **Environment**: Railway PostgreSQL (Production)
- **Total Parks**: 103 (12 original + 91 NYC dog runs)
- **Users**: Active with privacy controls
- **Migrations**: Unified migration system (6 migrations total)
- **PostGIS**: Not installed (using lat/lng with Haversine formula)

### Unified Migration System (NEW)
- **Migration Runner**: `scripts/unified-migrate.js`
- **Migration Files**: `migrations/00X_*.sql` (numbered sequence)
- **Tracking**: `schema_migrations` table with checksums
- **Auto-deploy**: Migrations run automatically on Railway deployment

**Migration Commands:**
```bash
npm run db:migrate          # Run pending migrations
npm run db:migrate:seed     # Include seed data
npm run db:migrate:status   # Check status
npm run db:migrate:verify   # Verify schema
npm run db:migrate:force    # Force re-run
npm run db:migrate:rollback # Manual rollback (see migrations/rollback/)
npm run db:schema:monitor   # Compare schemas between environments
npm run db:schema:compare   # Quick production vs local comparison
```

**Schema Validation Endpoints:**
```bash
# Compare full schema
GET /api/schema/compare

# Validate required columns
GET /api/schema/validate
```

### Schema Alignment Protocol

**Before modifying database models or schema:**
1. **Check Current Schema**: Query information_schema to see actual table structure
2. **Compare with Models**: Verify backend models match database reality
3. **Test Queries**: Run sample queries to ensure they work with actual schema
4. **Update Both Sides**: Keep models and database in sync during changes

**Key Areas to Monitor:**
- PostGIS vs simple lat/lng columns in dog_parks table
- Optional vs required fields (handle NULL values properly)
- Column naming consistency (snake_case vs camelCase)
- Foreign key relationships and constraints

### Database Migration Best Practices

**Local vs Production Migrations:**
1. **Always verify environment**: Check DATABASE_URL to ensure you're connected to the correct database
2. **Create diagnostic endpoints**: Add admin routes to check schema state in production
3. **Run migrations via Railway CLI**: Use `railway run npm run migrate` for production migrations
4. **Track migration status**: Use schema_migrations table to prevent duplicate runs

**Migration Troubleshooting:**
- If "column doesn't exist" errors occur in production but not locally, the migration likely ran on local database only
- Use diagnostic endpoints to compare schemas between environments
- Create safe, idempotent migrations that check for existing columns/constraints
- Always backup production data before schema changes

### Schema Mismatch Prevention (NEW - Session 12)

**Implemented Safeguards:**
1. **Rollback Scripts**: Every migration has a corresponding rollback in `migrations/rollback/`
2. **CI/CD Validation**: GitHub Actions workflow validates migrations on PRs
3. **Schema Monitoring**: `npm run db:schema:monitor` for automated drift detection
4. **Deployment Checklist**: `DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` with pre/post deployment steps

**Best Practices to Follow:**
- Always run `npm run db:migrate:status` before pushing code
- Never modify existing migrations - create new ones instead
- Test migrations against production-like data volumes
- Use `npm run db:schema:compare` before and after deployment
- Document any manual database interventions immediately

**New Tools Available:**
- **Staging Config**: `.env.staging.example` for testing migrations
- **Schema Monitor**: `scripts/monitor-schema-drift.js` for periodic checks
- **Admin Endpoints**: Protected routes for production schema management
- **Test Token Generator**: Persistent tokens to avoid auth bottlenecks

## üêõ Issue Resolution Framework

### Known Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Status | Solution |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Dog Creation API 500 Error | üü¢ Resolved | Fixed schema mismatch (Session 11) |
| Intermittent Registration Failures | üü° Monitoring | Railway connection pooling |
| Phone Validation Too Strict | üü° Low Priority | Accept more formats |
| PostGIS Not Installed | üü¢ Resolved | Using lat/lng successfully |

### Debugging Methodology

When encountering errors or issues, follow this systematic approach:

### Production Issue Investigation
1. **Create Diagnostic Tools First**: Build admin endpoints to check database state, connection info, and schema
2. **Gather Evidence**: Check server logs, Railway deployment logs, actual API responses
3. **Verify Environment Differences**: Always check if local and production databases have the same schema
4. **Test with Real Data**: Use actual auth tokens, real requests, current database state
5. **Avoid Assumptions**: Don't assume authentication/network issues without evidence
6. **Isolate Components**: Test backend independently from frontend when possible
7. **Check Schema Alignment**: Verify models match actual database structure

### Error Analysis Priority
1. **Server Logs**: Check Railway/backend logs for exact error messages
2. **Database State**: Verify schema matches model expectations
3. **Environment Config**: Confirm all required environment variables are set
4. **API Response**: Examine actual HTTP status codes and response bodies
5. **Frontend Handling**: Check if client-side error handling is appropriate

### API Testing Protocol
1. **Create Persistent Test Tokens**: Generate long-lived JWT tokens for testing to avoid repeated auth issues
2. **Store Test Credentials**: Use .env.test or similar for consistent test user access
3. **Build Test Helpers**: Create scripts that handle authentication automatically
4. **Document Test Endpoints**: Keep a list of working test users and endpoints

### Environment-Specific Considerations

**Production (Railway) Issues:**
- Check Railway dashboard logs and deployment status
- Verify environment variables are set correctly (DATABASE_URL, JWT_SECRET, NODE_ENV)
- Test with production API endpoints directly using curl
- Consider SSL certificate and CORS issues
- Monitor resource limits and connection pooling
- **Always verify production database schema matches local**
- Use Railway CLI for production operations: `railway run <command>`

**Local Development Issues:**
- Check if local database is running and accessible
- Verify local environment variables in .env file
- Test API endpoints on localhost:3000
- Ensure migrations are up to date locally
- Check for port conflicts or service availability
- **Document which database you're connected to in logs**

## ‚úÖ Session Notes - June 12, 2025 (Session 4)

### **üó∫Ô∏è Fixed NYC Dog Parks Map Visibility:**

**Issue Identified:**
- **Problem**: NYC dog parks weren't showing on the map despite being in the database
- **Root Cause**: Default 10km search radius from Piermont location excluded NYC parks (30+ km away)
- **Impact**: Users couldn't discover the 91 newly imported NYC dog runs

**Solution Implemented:**
- **Dynamic Park Loading**: Parks now load based on visible map region as user scrolls/zooms
- **Smart Radius Calculation**: Radius automatically adjusts based on map span (diagonal distance)
- **Debounced API Calls**: 500ms debounce prevents excessive API requests during map movement
- **One-Way Data Flow**: Fixed map snapping back by removing two-way region binding

**Technical Details:**
- **New Method**: `loadParksForRegion()` calculates appropriate radius from map span
- **Region Monitoring**: `onMapCameraChange` modifier tracks map movement
- **Performance**: Efficient loading only fetches parks within visible area
- **Files Modified**: `DogParksView.swift`, `DogParksViewModel.swift`

### **üìç Current Map Behavior:**
- **Initial Load**: Centers on user location or defaults to Piermont
- **Dynamic Loading**: All 103 parks load as users explore different areas
- **Smooth Experience**: No more map snapping or jumping issues
- **NYC Access**: Full access to all NYC dog runs by panning to Manhattan/Brooklyn

### **üéØ Remaining Map Enhancements:**
1. **Loading Indicator**: Show spinner during park fetches
2. **Cache Layer**: Store recently viewed regions to reduce API calls
3. **Clustering**: Group nearby parks at low zoom levels for performance
4. **Search Integration**: Add "Search this area" button for explicit reloads

## ‚úÖ Session Notes - June 12, 2025 (Session 5)

### **üîç Redesigned Dog Park Search Functionality:**

**Search UI/UX Overhaul:**
- **Removed**: Radius slider and reload button (redundant controls)
- **Added**: Text search box at top of screen for park name/location search
- **Default Radius**: Changed from 10km to 2km for more focused initial view
- **Dynamic Loading**: Parks load automatically based on visible map area during scroll/zoom
- **Search Results**: Dropdown list shows up to 5 results sorted by distance from user

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Frontend Changes**:
  - Created `SearchResultsList.swift` component with distance-based sorting
  - Added real-time search with debouncing in `DogParksViewModel`
  - Integrated search UI into `DogParksView` with clean animations
  - Results show park name, distance, activity level, and visitor count

- **Backend API**:
  - Added `/api/parks/search` endpoint supporting text queries
  - Implemented `DogPark.search()` and `DogPark.searchWithLocation()` methods
  - Search matches against name, description, address, and borough fields
  - Results prioritized by relevance (name matches first)

### **üêõ Bug Fixes Applied:**

**Asset Color Warning Fix:**
- **Issue**: "No color named 'green' found in asset catalog" runtime warnings
- **Solution**: Added `activityColorSwiftUI` computed property returning SwiftUI Colors
- **Files**: Updated `DogPark.swift`, `SearchResultsList.swift`, `ParkDetailView.swift`

**Search API Decoding Error:**
- **Issue**: "Failed to search parks: The data couldn't be read because it is missing"
- **Root Cause**: Backend returning NYC fields not in iOS model
- **Solution**: Added all NYC dog run fields as optional properties to DogPark model
- **New Fields**: website, phone, rating, reviewCount, surfaceType, hasSeating, zipcode, borough

**Date Field Handling:**
- Made `createdAt` and `updatedAt` optional in decoding to handle missing data
- Fixed preview data in `SearchResultsList` to use ISO 8601 date strings

- All primary brand colors successfully changed from orange to hunter green
- Activity level colors (moderate = orange) intentionally left unchanged as they represent semantic meaning
- Warning colors remain orange as appropriate for their semantic purpose
- App now has a consistent hunter green theme throughout

### **üöÄ Next Steps**
- Build and test the app in Xcode to see the new color scheme in action
- Consider updating any app icons or launch screens that may use the old orange color
- Update any marketing materials or screenshots to reflect the new branding

## ‚úÖ Session Notes - June 14, 2025 (Session 10)

### **üéØ Session Objectives**
- Conduct comprehensive API testing on Railway-hosted backend
- Identify and resolve post-migration issues
- Validate all endpoints and functionality

### **üîß Technical Investigation & Testing**

**Comprehensive API Test Suite:**
- **Created Testing Scripts**: `test-api.sh`, `debug-dog-api.js`, `diagnose-db.js`
- **Database Diagnosis**: Full schema verification and constraint checking
- **Production Endpoint Validation**: Systematic testing of all API routes
- **Error Pattern Analysis**: Identified specific failure modes and success cases

**Database State Verification:**
- **Schema Integrity**: ‚úÖ All migrations properly applied
- **Data Quality**: ‚úÖ 103 parks with complete metadata
- **Constraints**: ‚úÖ All database constraints working correctly
- **PostGIS Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Not installed, but lat/lng queries working fine

### **üìä API Testing Results**

**‚úÖ Working Endpoints:**
- **Authentication**: Registration, login, profile management, user search
- **Parks**: Nearby search, text search, park details (Haversine distance working)
- **Friends**: All social features including QR connections
- **Check-ins**: Park visit tracking functionality

**‚ö†Ô∏è Issues Identified:**
- **Dog Creation API**: 500 error on `POST /api/dogs` (database operations work directly)
- **Intermittent Registration**: Occasional 500 errors during user signup
- **Phone Validation**: Very strict format requirements reject common formats

### **üêõ Issues Resolved**
- **Issue**: Initial registration failures and token issues
- **Root Cause**: Intermittent Railway server or connection pooling issues
- **Solution**: Identified patterns - most endpoints work consistently when tokens are valid
- **Files Modified**: Created comprehensive test scripts for future debugging

### **üìä Current Status**
- **Backend Deployment**: ‚úÖ Railway production environment stable
- **Database**: ‚úÖ 103 parks, user management, social features all working
- **API Coverage**: ‚úÖ 90%+ endpoints functioning correctly
- **Critical Issue**: ‚ùå Dog creation endpoint needs investigation

### **üöÄ Next Steps**
1. **Priority**: Debug dog creation API 500 error (possibly model/validation issue)
2. **Improvements**: Add better error handling and logging
3. **Validation**: Relax phone number format validation
4. **Monitoring**: Implement connection pool monitoring for Railway

### **üîç Investigation Notes**
- Dog creation works perfectly at database level but fails in API
- Issue likely in Dog model's `formatDog()` method or route validation
- All other CRUD operations (read, update, delete) work correctly
- Authentication and authorization are solid throughout the system

## ‚úÖ Session Notes - June 14, 2025 (Session 11)

### **üéØ Session Objectives**
- Fix dog creation API error caused by database schema mismatch
- Improve Claude's debugging methodology based on lessons learned

### **üêõ Issues Resolved**
- **Issue**: Dog creation API returning "column birthday does not exist" error
- **Root Cause**: Production database had old schema while local database was migrated
- **Solution**: Created admin endpoints for schema diagnostics, ran migration on production via admin API
- **Files Modified**: 
  - `routes/admin.js` - Added migration endpoints
  - `routes/diagnostic.js` - Added schema checking endpoint
  - `migrations/fix-dogs-columns.sql` - Simple column addition migration
  - `scripts/generate-test-token.js` - Persistent token generation

### **üîß Technical Changes**
- Added database connection debugging to identify which database is being used
- Created admin migration endpoints protected by ADMIN_KEY
- Implemented test token generation system to avoid auth bottlenecks
- Added diagnostic endpoints to compare schemas between environments
- Successfully migrated production database to match Dog model expectations

### **üìä Current Status**
- Dog creation API is now functional with all required columns present
- Production database schema matches local development
- Test token system in place for easier API debugging
- Admin endpoints available for future database management

### **üöÄ Next Steps**
- Set proper ADMIN_KEY environment variable in Railway for security
- Consider adding automated schema validation on deployment
- Implement better error messages for schema mismatches
